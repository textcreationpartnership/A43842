            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Brethren! Do not ſtartle, or fly back becauſe I call you ſo: Like thoſe ſeditious, and turbulent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, who retus'd to give this ſweet Title of Relation to any, but only to thoſe <hi>Traditores</hi> (as <hi>Optatus</hi> calls them) who were their own Partiſans in iniquity, and the miſ-ſhapen Members of the <hi>African</hi> fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as themſelves. I am ſure, we have all one common Father, if we are yet thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46429:4"/>reconcil'd to that Prayer, wherein we call him ſo. And if we have not the ſame Mother too, it is not only our guilt, but our ſhame: For whilſt we divide the ſeamleſs Coate of Chriſt; and every party will have an <hi>Ephod,</hi> and a <hi>Teraphim,</hi> a Church of his own modelling; we maintain the worſt ſort of Poligamy in the World, in making Chriſt to have as many Spouſes as ever <hi>Solomon</hi> had Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</p>
               <p>And whilſt we go about to diſown that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or which is worſe, ſcratch her by the face, and call her Whore; on whoſe knees we have been dandled, nouriſhed by her breaſts, and carried in her womb; we do but debaſe our ſelves into a viperous and ſpurious Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Methinks I ſee the Church of <hi>England</hi> wringing her hands; and hear her complaining againſt ſuch diſobedient Children, or rather Apoſtatizing <hi>Julians;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>and give ear O Earth, I have nouriſhed and brought up Children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and they have rebelled againſt me. My Friends have dealt treacherouſly with me, they are become mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now I have made you ſport enough, in calling the Church our Mother; And your Proſelytes dance after the ſame pipe: They are never more merry, then when they ſpeak of the Sons and daughters of the Church by way of deriſion: as if this were a fond, and ridiculous <hi>Soloeciſm.</hi> Into what profuſe, and intemperate laughter, have many of you, and them, broke forth in my hearing? as if your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46429:4"/>ſides would have burſt aſunder, at the very mention of the Sons and Daughters of the Church. But ſtay Sirs! Suppreſs your ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpleenes, and lets be ſerious. What you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem our reproach, that we account our own glory. And if it be vile in your eyes, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, regular, peaceable, and walking by innocent Canons, we are reſolv'd to be more vile yet. It was <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s joy, that he was a Member of the Church; and it is ours, not only that we are ſo, but that we are not erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, and extravagant in our Motions; every member obſerving its own office, and ſtation; as all the Servants did, in <hi>Solomons</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Tell me true! is it ſuch an abſurdity to be ſtil'd the Sons and Daughters of the Church? did you never read of the <hi>Sons and daughters of Zion?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 4.2.</note>

               <p>Give me leave to give an inſtance of my own experience; and that's a very convincing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.

It was but time for ſuch conceited Rabbies, and ſtrutting Mountebanks to diſappear, who by ſoaring too high, had put out their own eyes; and to leave their uſurped charges, to more ſober, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poyſed <hi>Raphaels.</hi> And though ſome of them are naturally alive; yet becauſe I hope mine eyes ſhall never ſee them again in that capacity, I ſhall write out the ſame Epitaph for them, as the Hyſtorian ſet upon <hi>Nero, —Sua imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas,</hi>

               <p>When in a ſeſſion of this very Parliament, it was urged with no ſmall vehemency, backed with the interceſſions and intereſts of great perſonages—that the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion, might be freely tolerated in theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, (and if the Serpent had thus wound in his head, it is eaſie to divine what would follow) when ſome began to warp, others to ſtagger, and ſome <hi>Barnabas's</hi> had like to have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with this torrent; as if they thought it but reaſonable, that ſuch as had been men of fidelity and courage heretofore, ſhould now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this donative, and reap this harveſt of a <hi>Toleration.</hi> Then ſtood up theſe <hi>Phinchas's,</hi> and partly by their obſecrations to his ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, partly by their convincing and nervous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in publick, they daſhed this coccatrice, when it was ready to peep out of the ſhell.

Is it not for our good that they ſit in Parliament? That they are vigilant and provident there, as our Repreſentatives, both to prevent what may be prejudicial to us, and alſo to interpoſe and move in our behalf: Is it not for our honour, that they are thus exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who were taken out of our ſelves? May not this ſhield off ſome of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which the people are apt to caſt upon us? and if we be injur'd, and oppreſs'd, is it not <hi>for a conſolation,</hi> that we have ſuch heads of our Tribes, ſuch Fathers of our Family, into whoſe boſome we may empty our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, who will be as ready to releive as to hear us. And if our grievances are above the ſphere of their own activity, yet they can appeal to higher authorities; when ſuch little ones as we are, can ſcarce be admitted.</p>

                  <hi>This is to bear rule like the Princes of the Gentiles.</hi> Thus you run away with this Text like Lapwings with ſhells upon your heads, as if 'twere not poſſible to overtake you. And you think your ſelves ſo deeply intrench't in the authority of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46429:23"/>as if it were impoſſible to beat you out of this fortreſs: yet lets ſpend ſome ſecond thoughts upon it; and ſearch it with a narrower eye: 'Tis true, our Saviour prohibits all affectation of honour among his Apoſtles, he would not have them ſtrive after greatneſs; but to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the meaneſt, that they may win all ſorts of perſons, by their humility. <hi>Dominatio interdicitur, judicitur miniſtratio.</hi> They muſt not hunt after dominion, but like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels they muſt be <hi>miniſtring Spirits.</hi> Yet that there ſhould be no prerogative and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence one above another, this is not forbidden at all in that place. Indeed Chriſt would not have his Apoſtles to have any violent, or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive juriſdiction over their Brethren in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the power of the Sword: He would have them to leave that to temporal Princes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid, <hi>it ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> that is, as it, is with civil Magiſtrates, Princes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, puniſhing offenders with corporal ſtripes. And accordingly our Biſhops, meddle not with criminal matters; but as I am inform'd, they go forth of the Parliament houſe, when ſentence of death is pronounced againſt Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.</p>
               <p>You might as well conclude that no men ſhould be called <hi>Maſters, Fathers, Lords,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſayes—<hi>Be not called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.—Call no man Farher upon Earth.—There is but one Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

The Biſhops hands are not more Authentick than theirs. Beſides ſhould we admit of another ordination; what is this, but to confeſs our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer void; and then what ſhall become of thoſe children, which we have Baptiſed and other minſterial acts which we have performed by vertue of that ordination; this is objected but by ſome of you and thoſe juniors, who came up in the time of the ſecond Temple, and did not <hi>behold the glory of the firſt:</hi> And herein, your condition is the more to be pittied, as being deceived and betrayed into ſuch a labyrinth as this, by thoſe that had ſeen more years, and ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46429:30"/>ſhould have been more fatherly: I wiſh the complaint of <hi>Cyprian</hi> may not hold in this caſe—<hi>Parentes Parricidae</hi> — Fathers are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, poyſon their children, and give <hi>them ſour Grapes to ſet their teeth on edge.</hi> I cannot but apply to them the caſe of the young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that man of God, who was led out of his way by an old Prophet, ſo that he brake the commandement of the Lord and at laſt was ſlain by a Lyon:<note place="margin">1 King. 13.24.</note>

               <p>Sirs, look about you: Will you ſtand in the Market place all the day idle, out of a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome ring leaders of a party, who thought to have retrench'd the footſteps of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſcipline, and pull'd up the Land-marks of Catholick order in the Church; that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons acting in the miniſtry might derive from them and commence from the Epoche of their juriſdiction. Juſt as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made new Prieſts, after he had made an innovation in the political Government. The old Wells muſt be ſtopt up, and new found Ciſterns muſt be ſet abroach. If one ſhould ask theſe recuſants whether they had not at firſt an inward call from God, I'le warrant you, they would make it as evident to Maſter <hi>Nye</hi> (if he were again in his chair) both as to the time, and manner of ſuch a call, as ever it is apparent that young <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Prophets, and Apoſtles, were called by a ſignal voice from Heaven: Yet this call from God muſt be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, or utterly neglected, if it be not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and confirm'd by ſuch men as they phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and approve; as if they were the <hi>ſervants of men,</hi> and came on their errand, rather than the Embaſſidours of Chriſt, and Nuncio'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore 'tis no contradiction in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>—that <hi>he was not an Apoſtle of men nor by men,</hi>

Now, ſince the looſing the golden reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in head ſtrong times, ſome that were but meer Presbyters themſelves, by a too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate boldneſs, took upon themſelves a power of making and propagating others like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, where they meet with officious Clients, ſuch as were willing to be made currant by their ſtamp; it hath pleaſed our Legitimate Governours, after a Jubilee of an happy reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to prevent ſchiſm, and confuſion among Miniſters, that they may not claim from ſeveral Originals, and ſo maintain divers intereſts, and like <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> ſtruggle in the womb of the Church, and endanger the rending of her bowels; as thoſe <hi>lay-Corinthians</hi> did; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſome cry'd up <hi>Paul</hi> ſome <hi>Apollos.</hi> It hath pleaſed the wiſdom of the foreſaid Authority to command—that all profeſſing to take upon them the work of the miniſtry, ſhould paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of the Reverend Biſhops, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The very Calendar you ſay is intollerable: For therein is injoyned the obſervation of feſtival dayes, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of man. I will not diſpute with you about the change of the Sabbath day, from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grant that to be by Apoſtolical and divine Authority than raiſe any duſt about it. Yet this hinders not but that it is in the power of the Church to ſet apart other dayes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I am confirmed herein, becauſe I find dayes of thankſgiving, and faſting ſet apart in the Scriptures, by comiſſion from men; and <hi>I</hi> have ſeen the like practiſed by your ſelves, I find the

We <hi>Honour the Saints;</hi> and if we ſhould not, I find by experience, we ſhould give the Papiſts juſt offence; yet <hi>we do not adore them:</hi> We deſire to imitate thoſe vertues and graces that were in the Saints: We rejoyce at their conqueſt over the World, their triumph in Heaven; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they keep an holy-day in rejoycing at our welfare; eſpecially when we are converted from our ſins. Above all we deſire to glorifie God himſelf; who ſanctified them on earth, inabled them to do and ſuffer gloriouſly, and hath now enroll'd them in them in the Calender and dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in Heaven; <hi>He is wonderful in all his Saints.</hi> We make no ſhrines for them, or go a pilgrimage to viſit their remains: We fall not down to their repreſenting pictures, only we retain their hyſtorical memorial, that we may ſhew our ſelves their genuine poſterity; as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by beholding the Images of their Noble Anceſtours, were inflam'd to an imitation of their Heroical Acts.

There is yet another Bank caſt up againſt Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes—They contradict the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſayes, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour.</hi> Therefore none of thoſe dayes are to be ſet apart for recreation, or feſtivity. This was preſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me by a plain perſon under my own charge; yet 'tis eaſie to divine out of whoſe quiver this ſhaft was derived, or on whoſe Anvil it was ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd. <hi>Grotius</hi> unties this knot: For the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative Mood (ſayes he) in this place, or (which is all one among the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Tenſe, <hi>Senſum tantum ſinendi habet,</hi> doth only ſignifie permiſſion—Thou ſhalt, that is, thou may'ſt work ſix dayes.

'Tis true what <hi>Jerom</hi> ſayes—<hi>Librum Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum Eccleſia non recepit:</hi> Thoſe Books are not looked upon as any part of Canonical Scripture: Their Authority is not to be depended upon, as to prove any Article of Faith, or to be a rule of that doctrine which is neceſſary to ſalvation. Yet who is ignorant; except thoſe who never read thoſe ancient Books, that therein are many excellent Lectures of morality, much conducing to the regulation of mens manners; though I will not commit Scripture with Scripture; nor compare the Apocrypha with any part of the Old and New Teſtament, yet I refer it to your own conſideration, whether many Chapters in the Apocrypha may not ſeem to convey more of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification to the generality of people, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſtruſe geneological Chapters in the Old Teſtament. I am ſure our Saviour had an eye to this end, when in his quotations out of the Old Teſtament, he hath more regard to the reading of the Septuagint, than of the Original <hi>Hebrew;</hi> Becauſe that was more common and better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by his Auditours: And whether it was for this reaſon that the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Chap. 13.25. quotes that place out of Apocrypha 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 7.7. It deſerves your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts.</p>
               <p>If you except againſt theſe Books, as of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority only, and therefore not to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46429:43"/>read in the Congregation; I demand of you, whether the Scriptures as divided into Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and read in our tranſlations, as alſo the Pſalms ſung in our metre and contents of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not ſo: neither is it any ſtrange thing to read in the Church occaſionally, even Books of humane compoſure, as well as <hi>Clements</hi> Epiſtles in the primitive times. But if all this will not reconcile your minds to our Calendar, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſome Chapters out of the Apocrypha, what follows methinks ſhould more than ſatisfie any rational men, who are not pertinaciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to lye under their own doubts and fears. Rather than loſe your communion, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of your Miniſtry upon this account, the Church is ſo indulgent, as in this matter, almoſt to leave you to your own liberty, I mean ſo far, as to exchange one Chapter for another, the Apocrypha for Canonical Sripture, as appears by <hi>the Preface to the ſecond part of the Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> O that there were ſuch an heart in you! as to be ſutably diſpos'd <hi>(Ruendo in occurſum)</hi> by meeting ſo tender a Mother in complying with her innocent conſtitutions!</p>

               <p>But is it ſuch an unpardonable fault in our prayers that many of them are ſhort? What think you of ejaculations, are not they prayers? and commonly the moſt fervent: There is moſt of a ſpiritual <hi>Impetus</hi> exerted in them: (as thoſe that have but a ſhort race to run, their ſtrength ſerves them to run the faſter) And is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their very nature to be ſhort? What think you of all the prayers mention'd in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? were not <hi>Moſes, Hezekiah, David, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> nay Chriſt himſelf as able as any of us, to lengthen out their prayers? yet where have they left us any pattern upon Record? of prolix pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and volumnious prayers? except you will ſay the Book of the Pſalms are ſo. But then why do you ſit at the reading of them? Is that a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſture for prayer, and praiſes? we read that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> pray'd at midnight; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd until midnight <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. but I find none praying ſo long together. That prayer of our Saviours <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.7. is the longeſt I can think on at preſent. Yet though I read no long prayers in Scripture, I read of them but with a ſharp ſpit, on black brand before them in three of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts: <hi>Wo unto you Scribes, Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, for you devour Widdows houſes, and for pretence make long prayers:</hi> Or as ſome read it <hi>—Simulantes orationem longam:</hi> Not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, but fainting and counterfeting the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. That under the pretence of a long grace they might eat the greater dinner, in ſwallowing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46429:49"/>Widows houſes at a bitt: Widows houſes did I ſay? I wiſh that ſome under this pretence, had not thought to have taken <hi>the houſes of God into poſſeſſion;</hi> had not the gobbets been too hard of digeſtion; had not the great <hi>Paterfamilias</hi> and Land-Lord of theſe houſes, granted <hi>Davids</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation againſt ſuch ſacrilegious cormorants —<hi>O my God! make them like unto a wheele!</hi> that is; making them ſo giddy, that they let go their hold.</p>
               <p>If we came with a good ſtomack, I mean with ſuch a Chriſtian appetite, and diſpoſition of ſoul, as we ought to do, when we joyn together in prayer; the ſhortneſs would not offend us, but rather prevent that tediouſneſs, which is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to our fleſh and blood, in our devotions, and a means to make them new, freſh, and vigorous, at every period. As after <hi>Moſes</hi> had been praying in the Mount,<note place="margin">Exol. 12.7.</note> his hands began to be heavy; had not <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> held them up. It is not ſo eaſie (as ſome account it) to wind up the ſoul to an heavenly pitch, and to keep it at that bent for any duration of time: Sure I am, the beſt of Gods people have complain'd of coolings, ſlacknings, and diſtractions in this caſe; and after their prayers, could even have caſt ſtones at themſelves, and beat upon their own breaſts, when they have reflected upon their languiſhing devotions. Therefore the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our prayers, and the peoples reſponſes are ſo many helps to our infirmities; as ſo much Cork or as ſo many bladders to keep us from ſinking into the Gulph, or dead ſea of a lither, and dull kind of oſcitancy.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Concerning the Salvation of Infants dying after Baptiſm.</head>
               <p>THe poſition concerning Children Baptiz'd — <hi>That if they dye before actual ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they ſhall be undoubtedly ſav'd,</hi> doth much offend you though 'tis no part of the Lyturgy, injoyn'd to beread at any time. But ſome of you ſay 'tis ſuch a doctrine as is purpoſely ſet down, to bring in <hi>Pelagianiſm, Arminianiſm, Popery</hi> and I know not what.</p>
               <p>Thus you are ſtill afraid of ſhadows, and by your active fancies frame ſuch chymera's of danger, which have no footing in nature. That this aſſertion is no new invention, or addition of our times, Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> will inform you:<note place="margin">In his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons p. 50.</note> who affirms that it was anciently ſet down in the Rubrick before confirmation: And he doth as ſoundly prove in the ſame place—that Infants Baptized are without doubt juſtified,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 30</note> and if juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then they ſhall be alſo glorified: for the Apoſtle will by no means ſever theſe two, and I hope you will not ſay; this grave and eminent Divine was either <hi>Pelagian, Arminian</hi> or <hi>Papiſt.</hi> I hope you have the like charity for Biſhop <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi>

               <p>But pray tell me; was there not a reaſon, that this part of Catholick Doctrine, ſhould be reviv'd? was not Baptiſm too much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in your dayes? not only in the bold adminiſtration of it, by thoſe who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lawfully ordained and appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: But alſo by a curſed indifferency, whereby many perſons began to be careleſs of water-Baptiſm, as they call'd it, as if at beſt it did but ſerve as the marking an Horſe for a Common: as if it were an empty ſign without a ſeal: Was it not time then to vindicate the power and efficacy of this bleſſed Sacrament from ſuch incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? and to rub off this moſs which was growing over it? As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> magnified his office moſt, and gloried in his education, ſufferings, viſions, when impoſtors and falſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46429:54"/>Brethren went about to debaſe him. The Primitive Chriſtians put the croſs into their Banners, and made a ſhew of it openly, when the Heathens did moſt of all reproach it. As if by a kind of an Antiperiſtaſis ' other mens ſcorn did but adde to their honourable eſteem of it. This I take to be the reaſon, why the Ancients are ſo voluminous againſt Heathen-Worſhip, and ſuch Hereticks as deprav'd the Doctrine of the Trinity, and ſay ſo little concerning our differences with the Papiſts, or among our ſelves; becauſe that kind of Idolatry did moſt infeſt and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Church, and theſe controverſies were not yet brought forth by Satans Mid wifery in thoſe dayes.</p>
               <p>Object. But if Infants dying after Baptiſm are ſaved, then thoſe that dye before Baptiſm are damned.</p>

We are ſo farre from paſſing ſentence on poor Infants dying without Baptiſm, that we are ready to ſay with <hi>Calvin:</hi> If none can be ſaved but ſuch as are Baptiſed, <hi>Neceſſe erit Retrahi latronem de Regno Dei:</hi> The Theif muſt be thrown out of Paradiſe.<note place="margin">

               <p>You cry out indeed upon ſignificant ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as if preſently they were Sacraments: as if a Sign were both the <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>differentia,</hi> conſtituting the eſſence and definition of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: By the ſame Logick I have heard a punie Sophiſter proving a Man to be an Aſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is animal.

(As King <hi>James</hi> was wont to ſay) if not in things of this inferiour nature: Eſpecially where they are ſo ſuitable, that good men would not refuſe them, were they left to their own choice; as to kneel at prayer or at the Sacrament, which is delivered by the Miniſter praying: To ſtand at the Creed, and Goſpel, to ſhew that we will ſtand for the maintenance of them both: To ſtand at Praiſes, Himns, Songs of Thankſgiving (which are branches of prayer) and at that leſſer Creed, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,</hi> &amp;c. Muſt not God be ſerved with our bodies as well as

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Good Subjects may lawfully declare, or ſwear that 'tis not lawful to take up Arms againſt the King.</head>
               <p>THE next Mountain in your way, which you have not faith enough to remove, is, that you cannot declare it to be unlawful upon any pretence to take up Arms againſt the King. And this ſuggeſts one true reaſon, why ſome of you are ſo inveterately bent againſt the Lyturgy. —Take it in the words of our Martyr'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign —<hi>One of the greateſt faults ſome men found with the Common-Prayer-Book I beleive was this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 285.</note> 
                  <hi>that it taught them to pray ſo oft for me, to which petitions they had not loyalty enough to ſay Amen.</hi> This is ſuch a Shibboleth that ſome of your liſping tongues are not able to pronounce: And this diſcovers that the main ſpring, or <hi>primum mobile</hi> of your hearts, hurries you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. And herein we are the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, ſince many of you have choſen to flitt your habitations, and expoſe your wives and children to the mercy of the Pariſhes wherein they dwell; rather than take that oath of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (which in effect is no more than the oath of Allegiance in other termes) which the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Parliament thought fit, in theſe times of danger, to impoſe upon you that they might make a tryal how your pulſe beates, or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46429:64"/>how you ſtand affected to the Kings welfare, and the Kingdoms peace: Whether you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow the right line of <hi>David,</hi> or revolt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tents of <hi>Jereboam:</hi> And I wiſh that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer manners had not occaſioned this Law.</p>
               <p>Who is ignorant that one <hi>Sinon</hi> within the walls is more dangerous than a whole Armado without? one <hi>Doeg</hi> or <hi>Achitophel</hi> at home, than Armies of profeſſed enemies abroad? therefore 'tis a Proverb in ſome Countryes—<hi>God deliver us from our friends;</hi> that is ſuch as do ſalute, and ſtab us under the fifth rib at the ſame time. And may not Kings in ſuch a caſe, uſe lawful means and take ſecurity even by the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> of an oath? to diſtinguiſh chaff from wheat: bran from flower: who are <hi>Iſraelites indeed;</hi> ſuch as will obey Gods Vicegerent for Conſciſcience ſake; and ſuch as are Subjects in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive ſignification <hi>(per Antiphraſin)</hi> becauſe they will be no longer ſubject, than his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand doth comply with their own wills. If he croſs them, let him look to himſelf. <hi>To your Tents O Iſrael! we have no part in David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although ſuch perſons as theſe are (who can never be good Chriſtians, becauſe ill Subjects) will make as little Conſcience of oaths, as they do of their allegiance; yet the beſt of Kings have bound their Subjects unto them, by this kind of ligature.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 11.3.</note> When <hi>David</hi> came to the Crown, the <hi>Elders of Iſrael came to him to Haebron, and made a Covenant with him there.</hi> And when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſucceeded his Father,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.24.</note> all <hi>the Princes and mighty men ſubmitted themſelves
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46429:65"/>unto Solomon the King;</hi> or as it is in the Hebrew —<hi>they gave their hand under Solomon;</hi> which was the cuſtome,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.9.</note> or manner of ſwearing among the Hebrews;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 8.2.</note> as is apparent by <hi>Eliazar putting his hand under Abrahams thigh, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him:</hi> The Annotators therefore do with good reaſon underſtand <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of this oath of fidelity, <hi>Icounſel thee to keep the Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; that in regard of the oath of God.</hi> Hence it is that ſome of the more ſober diſſenters amongſt you, being convinced of this truth, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the ſcandal they ſhould gain, had they refuſed, have ſubmitted to the preſent oath; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I could make this addreſs—Go on my brethren maſtering and ſubduing all the remaining difficulties, until ye arrive both at the Penand the Pulpit. I hope that you having paſs'd this Iron-gate, you'l make no ſtop until we all meet in <hi>Navi Eccleſiae,</hi> in the body of the Temple; that we may not be <hi>Almoſt,</hi> but <hi>Altogether</hi> ſuch Subjects, Chriſtians, Miniſters, as may moſt advance our Maſters ſervice. <hi>Rumpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ilia!</hi> let their bowels (like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das's</hi>) guſh forth, who rather like Devils gnaſh with their teeth, than with Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the return and reception of ſuch bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly coadjutors—That's a poor ſurmiſe, that we are afraid leſt your glory ſhould eclipſe our names: No your glory ſhall be ours. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced at the flouriſhing of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>that it was ſpoken of through the world;</hi> ſo the luſtre of your parts, induſtry, piety, and integrity, ſhall be ſo farre from offending my weak eyes, that I ſhall exult with joy, that my Maſter is ſo well provided with ſervants; that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46429:65"/>I am the meaneſt of thoſe that wait at his Altar; and of the loweſt form in the ſchool of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>But I muſt break off this delightſome theme, and come to that more unpleaſing task, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with thoſe who refuſe to give this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their loyalty to their Prince. Sirs, where's the Thorne that pricks you? Are you troubled that your diſtinctions are cut off? that your old Avenews and Poſtern-Gates are in this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oath now ſhut up? Are there not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, or ſtarting-holes left open? Are you to be| ſo cloiſter'd up, that you can make no excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? 'Tis no wonder if men ſweat, that are ſo ſtrait lac'd; if the waters roar that are penn'd up with ſuch dams.</p>
               <p>Lets look back and ſee what pretences there were for an unnatural warre.<note place="margin">p. 141.</note> I may uſher in this diſcourſe as <hi>Jerom</hi> did his concerning the <hi>Arrians, Claudite aures, qui audituri eſtis, ne tantae impietatis vocibus polluamini.</hi>

               <p>Who can blame the King? if deſiring <hi>to live long, and to ſee good dayes</hi> (former tranſactions conſidered) to make a decree, that it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be unlawful to take up arms againſt himſelf, or thoſe that are commiſſionated by him, upon any pretences whatſoever. And ſince the lines of our peace and happineſs, as to Church and State, do meet and concenter in him as our Common Father; is it unreaſonable for Subjects to ſwear <hi>they will not endeavour the alteration of Government in the Church and State?</hi> Who would think that any Natives of a Land, profeſſing themſelves the followers of Chriſt (who in the dayes of his humiliation, was obedient to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he wrought a miracle to give him his due) and expecting protection from a lawful Prince, ſhould once demur whether they ſhould make this declaration, or take this Oath? <hi>Qui delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant deſciverunt,</hi> ſuch as doubt of this, have even ſhak'd off the yoke of ſubjection. Miſtake me not I am no virulent <hi>Tertullus,</hi> to draw up an indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you: I accuſe you not. But as Chriſt told the <hi>Jews there was one that accuſed them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Moſes:</hi> ſo there is one that accuſeth you by upbraiding you; beſtowing on you ſome <hi>Caeca verbera,</hi> and putting you ſometimes into a cold ſweat; I mean your own Conſcience. I muſt tell you too before we part, that if upon this account you court your own ſufferings, I would have you to conſider, whether <hi>ye ſuffer as Chriſtians for righteouſneſs ſake, And for well doing</hi> or whether <hi>you are buffeted for your faults.

I ſhould as ſoon ſet the crown of martyrdom upon the head of <hi>Thomas a Becket,</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> as adorn their foreheads who refuſed to put in caution for their fidelity and due ſubjection to their Prince. If ſuch perſons would be accounted loyaliſts, let them be ſo: But then let me have leave to derive their pedigree, or aſſign the reaſon of their denomination; and that is, becauſe they are of their Father <hi>Ignatius Loyala.</hi> It is a wonder to me, that we ſhould be <hi>adeo Hiſtricaſi</hi> (to uſe Saint <hi>Jeroms</hi> words) ſo prickley, ſharp and full of invectives againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for maintaining the lawfulneſs of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering proteſtant Princes, and yet the ſame men ſhould refuſe to declare and ſwear—<hi>That 'tis unlawful to take up Arms againſt the King upon any pretence whatſoever.</hi>

               <p>I wiſh theſe recuſants would conſider what difference there is, betwixt taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King (if the ſucceſs fall on their ſide) and un Kinging (I had almoſt ſaid un manning) of him I confeſs I have ſet my eyes as ſteddy as I could, and I have ſtrengthned them too with the ſpectacles of ſeveral Hiſtories, and I can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern but very little—Not as if all that ingag'd in the laſt War had this deſign; farre be it from me to be ſo uncharitable: For as ſome <hi>followed Abſolom againſt David, in the ſimplicity of their hearts;</hi>

So, ſuch as are ſenſual who never had the wind of Gods ſpirit winnowing them from their chaff; in unſettling them from their Lees, and ſecuring them from the common <hi>Maſs:</hi> Theſe diſcern not the Image of God upon the King: They ſmell none of Gods Oyl upon him: but look upon him as an ordinary perſon; and ſo they conceive not themſelves under an obligation of Conſcience to pay that reverence and obedience which is due unto him.

               <p>VVEll may the Covenant be compar'd to a Lyon; for it looks fierce and terrible, ſcattering abroad the very Arrows of death. And no wonder it is ſo deadly, and of ſo gaſtly a viſage: For it roſe lately from the dead, and ſtarted out of its own aſhes. This is the very <hi>Achilles,</hi> or <hi>Goliah,</hi> which is thought to be invincible, your <hi>Palladium,</hi> take this, and take all. It is ſuch a ſtone, as threatens to fall back and grind to powder thoſe that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to remove it. What renounce the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? We can read Common-Prayer (I have heard ſome ſay) but to be Covenant-breakers and to violate the oath of God this we cannot do: <hi>Nobis non licet eſſe tam profanis.</hi> Now I have followed you to the very Capitol, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is like the uncaſing of the head.</p>
               <p>Though we fight you not in the field (I have heard others ſay) yet wee'l pray you down, yet how can ye pray in Faith? upon what promiſe will ye ground ſuch prayers? But will you ſtop there? can you chuſe but ſecond your prayers with your ſtrenuous endeavours? will you (with the <hi>Oſtrich</hi>) <hi>leave theſe eggs in the duſt?</hi> and never look after theſe Arrows? 'Tis well that you have waſh'd out your former ſpots: for I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46429:77"/>obſerved heretofore that when the lightning of your prayers went before, the thunder, and clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of your Armour followed after: You us'd the <hi>Sword of Gideon,</hi> as well as the <hi>Sword of the Lord;</hi> when like <hi>Moſes,</hi> you went up into the mountain to pray, you had your Armies of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hues</hi> fighting in the vallies. But why do you call the Covenant the <hi>Oath of God?</hi> I read of that expreſſion but once in Scripture <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 2. and there no doubt it ſignifies the oath of Allegiance to the King. With what Engines can you wire-draw this text to the Covenant? What hath the Covenant to do with Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? How theſe agree together, we ſhall ſee afterwards; yet you may as well ſee Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Covenant, as diſcover the National Covenant in that of Baptiſm. A leading perſon of your way, told me once in diſcourſe.—<hi>That to renounce the Covenant, and to renounce Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is all one;</hi> this is juſt like another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of his: When I told him that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was impos'd upon Subjects, by Subjects: No ſaid he, —Parliament men <hi>(Sedente curi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion profeſſed among us, which is the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of our Church and Nation, and the joy of our ſouls would looſe much of its glorious luſtre and verdure with me, hadit been uſher'd in with Axes and Hammers, claſhing of Armour and roaring of Canons: Had it been eſtabliſh'd by rebellion, and not by the decrees, and laws of reforming Princes, who call'd our Fathers out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and led them out of ſpiritual <hi>Egypt.</hi> Kings (bleſſed be God, who put ſuch a thing as this into their hearts) were the nurſing Fathers of our Reformation: But alaſs, amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life was leaſt of all intended in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

               <p n="10">10. The matter of an oath ought to be plain and obvious to our underſtanding; without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and intricacy. I muſt know what I ſwear, otherwiſe I take Gods name in vain in ſwearing <hi>without judgment.</hi> Now in this oath there are many words of ambiguous ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As <hi>Common enemies, beſt reformed Churches</hi> (without telling which they are) <hi>Malignants, Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of Scotland, priviledges of Parliament,</hi> which in thoſe dayes were like the <hi>Popes</hi> Traditions, Arbitrary and Inexhauſtible.</p>
               <p n="20">20. There are plaine contradictions in this oath: For thoſe that have taken the oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and have therein ſworn to defend the King and his Rights <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely;</hi> yet here they muſt mince the matter and vow to defend the King himſelf with a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on —<hi>In the defence of Religion:</hi> So that if he do not what they would have him do in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, they have an evaſion at hand: by vertue of their Covenant they may defeat him; if not dethrone him. So he muſt be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46429:88"/>not a <hi>glorious King,</hi> reigning at the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum of his Subjects: nay, in their former oathes they ſwore to defend all the Kings Rights, whereof his juriſdiction in matters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal is not accounted the leaſt, yet here they vow to reform Religion themſelves and as it were ſnatch that Jewel out of their Soveraigns Crown. And as by this Covenant they violate their former oathes of Allegiance and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo they would have the King too, like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in violating his oath at his Coronation, when he ſwears to maintain Biſhops and their Rights.</p>
               <p>In this very Covenant they ſwear to maintain the liberties of Subjects; yet as if Biſhops were not Subjects, they ſwear to root them up root and branch.</p>
               <p n="30">30. There are groſs abſurdities in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Parliament is plac'd before|the King. The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Church of <hi>England.</hi> There is ſwearing to maintain the priviledges of Parliament abſolutely, but the King and his Rights with a limitation: As if a Parliament were infallible, not ſo the King; whereas to ſpeak properly, the Parliament is no Parliament at all without the King; no more than the trunk of a mans body is a compleat bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without his head.</p>
               <p n="40">40. The fourth Article of the Covenant is even unnatural, binding Children to betray their Parents to death, by bringing them to publick
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46429:89"/>tryals, If they are, or have been Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
               <p n="50">50. What deſperate Hypocriſie and prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is there in the third Article? the world <hi>muſt bear witneſs with the Covenanteers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of their loyalty; that they have no thoughts or intentions to diminiſh the Kings juſt power and greatneſs.</hi> Juſt like <hi>Herod,</hi> that told the wiſe men—they ſhould bring him word, where Chriſt was, and he would come and <hi>worſhip him:</hi> In plain Engliſh that is, he would come and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: <hi>praetendit cultum, intendit cultrum;</hi> or as <hi>Abſalom</hi> makes a flouriſh, that he would <hi>pay his vows in Haebron,</hi> but the truth was; he had a purpoſe to raiſe war againſt the King his Father.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.7.8.</note> So the ſame men that robb'd the King of his legiſlative power, of the Militia, and turn'd their ſwords againſt his very boſome, would have the world <hi>bear witneſs to their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty —that they have no thought or intention to diminiſh the Kings juſt power and greatneſs.</hi> They would fain have the World as guilty in violating the Ninth, as they themſelves have been in breaking the fifth Commandment.</p>
               <p n="60">60. But ſuppoſe the other Articles of the Covenant were free from all exceptions, and might paſs for currant, without any allowance; yet all the united skill of the Covenanteers in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (were the very quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all their parts ſtrain'd into the pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium of one Covenanting <hi>Achilles</hi>) can never juſtifie the matter of the ſecond Article, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the exſtirpation of prelacy: for had the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46429:89"/>houſes of Parliament been full and compleat when they paſſed this ordinance. Yet what Authority had they to pull up and retrench the very fundamentals of Government, which was ſo firmly rivited by the Laws of the Land, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and ſo many Acts of Parliament. Can a ſubordinate or leſſer power ſuperſede, or make voyd the decrees of that power which is greater,<note place="margin">Iſa: 66.8.</note> even the ſupreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Nation? <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing? Who hath ſeen ſuch things?</hi> It hath even pitied me to hear what fig-leav'd ſalvo's ſome have found for their Conſciences in this caſe. As I told you of one, that ſaid Parliament men were no Subjects; ſo others have told me—that they did not Covenant againſt Epiſcopacy, but againſt the Hierarchy: What an irrational ſubterſuge is this? What is the Hierarchy but an holy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and muſt this be rooted up? read the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next words of the Covenant and you will ſee what is underſtood by <hi>praelacy:</hi> that is, the <hi>Government by Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops.</hi> Yet the very ſame men that told me, they did not Covenant againſt Epiſcopacy, have refus'd to take the late Oath, why? becauſe they will not ſwear—<hi>Not to endeavour to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church:</hi> Have not theſe men <hi>Renbens</hi> curſe upon them? in being as <hi>Inſtable as water;</hi>
